# moeba-claude-channel

Claude Code channel for [Moeba](https://moeba.co.za) — chat with Claude Code from the Moeba mobile app.

## What it does

Bridges your Claude Code session to the Moeba app. Send messages from your phone, Claude Code processes them and replies back.

```
Moeba App → Moeba Server → SSE → Local MCP Channel → Claude Code
                        ← HTTP reply ← moeba_reply tool ←
```

## Install

```bash
npm install -g moeba-claude-channel
```

## Setup

Add to `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moeba": {
      "command": "moeba-claude-channel",
      "args": ["--login"],
      "autoApprove": ["moeba_reply", "moeba_progress"]
    }
  }
}
```

### First run

1. Start Claude Code — the channel starts automatically
2. Browser opens for Google/Apple sign-in (same account as your Moeba app)
3. Credentials cached at `~/.moeba/channel-<project>.json`
4. A **"Claude Code — \<project\>"** agent appears in your Moeba app

### Headless mode (SSH, CI, or setting up for another user)

No browser needed — pass an API key and email via env vars:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "moeba": {
      "command": "moeba-claude-channel",
      "args": ["--login"],
      "env": {
        "MOEBA_API_KEY": "mba_your_key_here",
        "MOEBA_EMAIL": "user@example.com"
      },
      "autoApprove": ["moeba_reply", "moeba_progress"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Multi-project support

Each project directory gets its own agent in the Moeba app:

- `Claude Code — kepler`
- `Claude Code — moeba`
- `Claude Code — roxy`

The project name is detected from the git repo. Override with `MOEBA_PROJECT` env var.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `moeba_reply` | Send a reply back to the Moeba user |
| `moeba_progress` | Show a typing indicator while working |

## Channel notifications

To enable Claude Code to auto-respond to incoming messages:

```bash
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:moeba
```

For fully unattended operation (no permission prompts — Claude can read/write files, run commands, etc.):

```bash
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:moeba --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

> **Warning:** Only use `--dangerously-skip-permissions` in trusted environments. Any message from an authenticated Moeba user can trigger file operations and command execution.
